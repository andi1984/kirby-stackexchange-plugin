Kirby CMS - Stack Exchange Plugin (in progess)
==========================

What?
----
> Stack Exchange is a fast-growing network of 92 question and answer sites on diverse topics from software programming to cooking to photography and gaming.

So [Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com/) is a really huge community with a lot of great, creative, mind-blowing people.

And the cherry on the cake isâ€¦ Stack Exchange provides a really good [API](http://api.stackexchange.com/ "Stack Exchange API")

Why?
----
So the last months I personally used Stack Exchange (in special Stack Overflow) a lot and the wish arose to show StackExchange Posts, Comments, Profiles etc. live on a Website without taking pictures of posts or copying text passages.

Furthermore I got in contact with [Kirby CMS](https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms "Kirby CMS") the last few weeks and I love to use this lightweight tool for personal usage.

So I decided to write this Stack Exchange Plugin for Kirby CMS also for my personal usage to show posts & answers from Stack Exchange (e.g. Stack Overflow Community) to discuss about web technologies etc.

How?
----
I want to write a fully flexible Stack Exchange plugin to provide everyone the full power of the API. I definitely want to use this plugin a lot in the future also for [my personal blog](http://dev.leben-zwonull.de/blog), sites etc.

I hope you like the idea and I hope you will give me feedback, feature, change or pull requests. ;-)

Are you interested?
----

Yes? Than take a look on the [Wiki-Page](https://github.com/andi1984/kirby-stackexchange-plugin/wiki/). I'll update the documentation there regularly.
